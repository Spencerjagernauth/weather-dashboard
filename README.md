# Weather-Dashboard
# Description
A weather dashboard that allows the user to access a city's current weather conditions and five day forecast. Third-party APIs are used to access weather data by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. 
I also used the OpenWeather API and local storage to save the user's search history and is displayed when they load the site.
